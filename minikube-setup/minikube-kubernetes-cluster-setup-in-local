install minikube from internet

-> To start minikube in local: minikube start
    minikube will internally start kubernetes
-> To view existing deployments in kubernetes: kubectl get deployments
-> To delete all the deployments in Kubernetes: kubectl delete deployment --all
-> To view the pods -> kubectl get pods
-> To view the services -> kubectl get services
-> To delete the services -> kubectl delete service service name
-> To delete specific deployment in kubernetes only: kubectl delete deployment hello-node

-> Command to create new deployment in Kubernetes: kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml   
-> validate pods: kubectl get pods
-> validate deployments: kubectl get deployments


deployment.yml:
===============

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: test-spring-boot-application
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: test-spring-boot-application
  template:

        app: test-spring-boot-application
    spec:

          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080

service.yml:
============

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: test-spring-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: test-spring-boot-application
  ports:
  - name: http
    port: 8080
    targetPort: 8080
    nodePort: 30005
   
kubectl apply -f service.yaml  

-> expose service via minikube: minikube service 

           
    
Note: image is the docker hub repo name
Note: Once deployment is succesfully created, validate pods by this command
  Kubectl get pods
Note: command to get minikube ip address -> minikube ip

Note: Due to some docker version issues, kubernetes cluster is not accessible via minikube ip address

Validation can be done in 2 ways:

- Validate port and rest api with local ip address -> example http://127.0.0.1:51579/test/app
- login into minikube docker image and run curl
     minikube ssh
     curl http://192.168.49.2:30005/test/app
